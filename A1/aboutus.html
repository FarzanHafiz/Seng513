Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Manchester United have won more trophies than any other club in English football,[5][6] with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields.
